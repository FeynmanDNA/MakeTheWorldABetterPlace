# YJG-Calculator-Webapp
This is an online calculator that calculates the DNA extension, linking number change, and structural state of DNA under given force and torque constraints, with DNA interactions with protein complexes and other DNA-inserts.

## Frontend
* React/Mobx/React-router, bootstrapped with Create-react-app + react-app-rewire-less, react-app-rewired, react-app-rewire-mobx
* UI-library: Ant-design
* Data visualization: React-vis
* Pdf viewer: React-pdf
* Ajax requests: Axios

## Backend
Flask and the [DNA transfer matrix calculator](https://bitbucket.org/FeynmanDNA/yjg-cpp-calculator/src/master/) (hosted in Bitbucket)

## Deployment
Nginx with Gunicorn+ufw+supervisor

## Theoretical papers
The underlying DNA transfer matrix calculator is based on the series of theoretical papers from Yan Jie's group:
- **Transfer-matrix calculations of DNA polymer micromechanics under tension and torque constraints** AK Efremov, RS Winardhi, J Yan, in *Physical Review E* 2016 ([link](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/~biosmm/Publications/PRE2016.pdf))
- **Theoretical Methods for Studying DNA Structural Transitions under Applied Mechanical Constraints** AK Efremov, RS Winardhi, J Yan, in *Polymers* 2017 ([link](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/9/2/74))
- **Transfer-matrix calculations of the effects of tension and torque constraints on DNAâ€“protein interactions** AK Efremov, J Yan, in *Nucleic Acids Research* 2018 ([link](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gky478/5033546))
